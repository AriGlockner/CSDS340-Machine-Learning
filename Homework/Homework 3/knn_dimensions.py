'''
a)
The fraction of data points within the unit hypersphere, i.e. the fraction of data points with
distance â‰¤ 1 from the origin (all zero coordinates). This measures roughly what fraction
of data points are close to a typical (all zero) data point
'''


'''
b)
The mean distance between a data point and its 1-nearest neighbor divided by the mean
distance between any pair of data points. This measures how close a nearest neighbor is
relative to a randomly selected data point. (As the number of dimensions increases, the
mean distance between any pair of data points also increases, so we divide by this to pro-
vide a fair comparison.)
